Main had issue running
Accidently bringing back node_modules while working with lab11, ultimately had to revert all commits and need to rework on lab 11. 
Added the node_modules folder to gitignore. 
Changed permissions for push to main. (to avoid unintentional accidental mistakes  in the future)
Insertion of sql files
People working on the login/registration were blocked by the api routes 
Have 1 demo game ready but yet to be linked with translation api.

The welcome page will be a tutorial full of introductory content. 
Most people’s changes and running code is still local to their own system and yet to be committed to the main branch. 
Chris has his game completed and is in the process of linking it with the cloud api from Hunor’s work. Need to embed games into 
Suggestion (TA): scores for each mini game for user profile page. 
The people responsible for games should communicate with the API person and have that link established. Could create more games in the meantime. 
Expectation for next week: functionality of the project should be 90-100%. Polishing very soon. 
Login/Registration/Game should be done within the following week (expected) 
Need to work on communication and planning. Suggestion (TA) should really work together and sit down to make sure no one accidentally pushes anything to main by accident. 
Suggestion (TA): still a lot of git issues that not everyone is familiar with. Should sit down together and review these just in case. 
Liam was able to push to main and everyone was able to merge into their local.
